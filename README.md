byte_theBeat is a contactless, Pi-Powered Drumkit, being developed for the Real Time Embedded Programming course (ENG5228) at the University of Glasgow.

## So what's the tempo?

The challenge set for this course was to develop any real time embedded project, using a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Â£50 budget.  
We found these awesome time-of-flight sensors from ST: [VL53L4CD](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l4cd.html))  and decided to turn them into "invisible" drum modules so that you can jam out in thin air!  
The distance values measured by the sensors are used to calculate a velocity - which in turn is used for "hit detection", so the timing and intensity of each drum hit can be determined.
